Subject: [PATCH 055/154] brcmfmac: disable command decode in sdio_aos for 4373

By disabling command decode, sdiod_aos module supports
the detection of sdio command line toggle only and
generates a wakeup request to PMU and to sdiod core.
It does not decode any sdio command and generates no
response to any command.
